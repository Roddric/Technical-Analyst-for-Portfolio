# Technical Indicator-Set Portfolio — Results Summary

**Project:** per-asset optimal pandas_ta indicator sets → composite signals → long-only monthly portfolio with turnover smoothing and signal-gated exits.
**Data:** daily OHLCV through 2026-07-01/06 (Yahoo). **Backtest:** 2024-01 → 2026-07 (2026 is a partial year).
**Selection discipline:** OOS sets frozen on data ≤ 2023-12-31; the IS (full-history) variant is an in-sample upper bound, not a forecast.

## Universe (14 assets)

Equities: S&P 500 (^GSPC), Nasdaq 100 (^NDX), FTSE 100 (^FTSE), KOSPI (^KS11), Nikkei 225 (^N225), TAIEX (^TWII), CSI 300 via ASHR ETF, VEA (developed ex-US), VWO (emerging).
Metals: Gold (GC=F), Silver (SI=F). Energy: WTI crude (CL=F). Crypto: BTC-USD, ETH-USD.
ASHR proxies CSI 300 because Yahoo's native index history starts 2021-03 — too short for selection.

A **fallback** slot had no indicator surviving the Benjamini-Hochberg false-discovery gate (q=0.10); the best-|IC_IR| candidate fills it as requested, but it is statistically weaker evidence. CL=F and ETH-USD sets are entirely fallback — treat their signals with extra skepticism.

Methodology: Spearman IC vs forward returns (h = 1/5/10/20) with Newey-West HAC p-values; composite = equal-weight average of sign-aligned, causally z-scored (252d/126) members; winner by |composite IC_IR| at h=20; traded sign = sign of composite IC at h=20 in the selection window.

## Strategy

At each month's first trading day (deciding on the prior day's data):

1. Rank all 14 assets by composite signal; take the top 8; **only positive-signal members are investable — the rest of the book sits in cash at 0%**; weight holdings by inverse 63-day volatility × rank tilt (1±0.5).
2. **Turnover smoothing:** the book moves only **halfway** (λ = 0.5) from its current drifted weights toward that target, so entries and exits fade over several months instead of snapping 15% → 0 → 15%. The largest single-rebalance weight change is 13pp (vs 28pp unsmoothed); turnover is ~1.5–2.4×/yr.
3. **Signal-gated exits:** a holding may be sold fully to zero **only when its own composite signal is non-positive**. A positive-signal holding that merely falls out of the top 8 is trimmed but floored at 0.5% until its signal actually flips.
4. Costs: 5 bps per side on turnover; long-only, no leverage; rf = 0.

## Backtest results

**OOS (the honest number):**

| Year | Return | Ann. vol | Sharpe (rf=0) | Max DD | Avg invested |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 2024 | +6.9% | 7.2% | 0.97 | −5.5% | 62% |
| 2025 | +31.7% | 11.5% | 2.48 | −11.6% | 78% |
| 2026 YTD | +12.5% | 16.1% | 1.57 | −7.5% | 77% |
| **Full** | **+58.5%** | **11.2%** | **1.72** | **−11.6%** | 71% |

**IS upper bound:** +86.8% full-period, Sharpe 2.21, maxDD −10.3%. **Equal-weight buy & hold benchmark:** +77.8%, vol 17.9%, Sharpe 1.39, maxDD −17.9%.

## Interpretation

- **The strategy's edge is risk-adjusted, not raw return**: it beats the benchmark on Sharpe (1.72 vs 1.39) and drawdown (−11.6% vs −17.9%) but trails on total return, because it averaged only ~71% invested in a strong bull period.
- **2024 lagged** (+6.9% vs +23.8%) from a double miss: 62% average investment (cash drag) *and* an invested sleeve tilted to Asia/commodities while US mega-caps led.
- **2025 is the signal working**: 78% invested, beating the benchmark outright (+31.7% vs +28.9%).
- **2026 YTD beats the benchmark** (+12.5% vs +11.4%) with a shallower drawdown — fading exits kept more of the rebound around the March and June sell-offs.
- **IS−OOS gap ≈ 28pp** over the full period: the measured cost of selection overfitting. Expect live results closer to OOS than IS.

## Walk-forward re-selection (v2 · F1)

The numbers above freeze each asset's set on a **single** cutoff (≤ 2023-12-31). `walkforward.py` instead **re-selects annually** on an expanding window (cutoffs 2023-12-31 → 2024-12-31 → 2025-12-31; each set governs the following year's monthly rebalances) and backtests the identical strategy. This is the honest test of whether the edge is a lucky-cutoff artifact.

| Variant | Full return | Ann. vol | Sharpe | Max DD |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **Walk-forward (re-selected)** | **+63.3%** | 10.6% | **1.91** | −10.6% |
| Frozen OOS (single cutoff) | +58.5% | 11.2% | 1.72 | −11.6% |
| In-sample (upper bound) | +86.8% | 11.7% | 2.21 | −10.3% |

- **Continuity check passes:** walk-forward 2024 = +6.9%, bit-identical to frozen OOS 2024 (2024's rebalances are all governed by the 2023-12-31 epoch) — confirms the date-stitching.
- **Re-selection improves on the frozen cutoff** on return, Sharpe *and* drawdown, and narrows the overfit gap: IS − walk-forward = **23.5pp** vs the frozen IS − OOS = **28.3pp**.
- **Set stability** across cutoffs is moderate: `^N225`/`^TWII` unchanged in all 4 slots, the trend slot is `dpo`-dominant, `VWO` churns most (2.5/4 per step). No sign of noise-fitting.
- **Honest limit:** only 3 annual epochs (2026 partial) — a directional robustness floor, not a statistically rich validation. Full report: `results/portfolio_backtest_walkforward.md`.

## Caveats (read before acting on any number)

Flat-history selection, not regime-conditioned. The canonical backtest freezes sets on a single cutoff; walk-forward re-selection (above) confirms the edge holds across 3 annual epochs but is not yet a rich validation. Composite ICs are small (0.02–0.13). Fallback slots bypass the FDR gate. The smoothing speed (λ = 0.5) was not selected out-of-sample. Index legs (^GSPC etc.) are proxies — live implementation needs futures/ETFs with their own costs. rf=0 in Sharpe. 2026 is half a year. Yahoo data quality applies throughout.
